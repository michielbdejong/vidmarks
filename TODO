[-] create a tags function to remove unassociated tags -- which is defined by a
tag that has no records associated with it in any of the scopes. To do this, the
following needs to happen:
  - when there are no more records in the tags scope, the scope file needs to
  be removed. So if names/my_tag/videos is empty, then videos should be
  deleted.
  - then the cleanup function can check for no files in a tag names dir, if
  there are none, then delete the tag name dir.
